# DiaRemot - Product Overview

## Purpose
DiaRemot is a CPU-only speech analysis pipeline that provides comprehensive audio processing capabilities including speech recognition, speaker diarization, emotion analysis, and conversation summarization. It's designed for production environments with strict dependency management and reproducible builds.

## Key Features

### Core Audio Processing
- **Speech Recognition**: Faster-Whisper based ASR with CTranslate2 optimization
- **Speaker Diarization**: ECAPA-TDNN based speaker identification and segmentation
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Silero VAD with configurable thresholds
- **Audio Preprocessing**: Standardized audio normalization and format conversion

### Affect Analysis
- **Emotion Recognition**: Multi-modal emotion detection from speech and text
- **Paralinguistics**: Speech characteristics analysis (pitch, energy, spectral features)
- **Intent Classification**: BART-based intent detection from transcribed text
- **Sound Event Detection**: CNN14-based environmental sound classification

### Intelligence Layer
- **Conversation Analysis**: Speaker behavior patterns and interaction dynamics
- **Summary Generation**: HTML and PDF report generation with visualizations
- **Timeline Analysis**: Temporal emotion and speaker activity tracking
- **Quality Control**: Automated pipeline validation and health checks

### Production Features
